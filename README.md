For my code, I used a movies dataset from the following Kaggle source.
I used the ratings.csv file.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset

This will later act as the producer and send the record to the record to the broker on VM3.



To run the code:
```
python3 producer.py
```
